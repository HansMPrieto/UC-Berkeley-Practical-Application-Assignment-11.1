The purpose of this project was to determine key drivers for used car prices. For this project, we performed a comprehensive analysis of a dataset containing information of 426k cars to identificat significant factors influencing the price of used cars. 

For this exercise, I decided to investigate the car's fuel type, the odometer reading of the car, and the condition of the car to see how it affects the price of the car. I decided to do my investigation specifically on Ford cars, as when I was looking at the "manufacturer" column in the dataset, I saw that the count for Ford Vehicles was higher than the other manufacturers in the dataset. Thus, I thought it would make sense to do my investigation on Ford cars.

Overall, I found that customers would tend to purchase diesel powered cars, than gas or hybrid cars. Also, I found out that cars with more than 10,000 miles tend to depreciate in value. Lastly, with regards to the condition of the car, I found out that customers tend to lean more towards "good" or "new" condition cars, as cars with these conditions tend to have a higher average price than cars with "excellent', "like new", "fair", and "salvage" condition cars.
